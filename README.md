## Documentation
Only documentation for the two main pipeline functions are needed, `bulk_long_pipeline` and
`sc_long_pipeline`. All documentation for `bulk_long_pipeline` is inherited from `sc_long_pipeline`,
so there is only one set of argument descriptions to be completed. Some of these are already done,
and any that aren't have 'NEEDED' next to the argument name. 

Thanks for the help!

### Documentation Needed
1. sc_long_pipeline.R
    1. sc_long_pipeline (these arguments are inherited for bulk_long_pipeline)
        1. Arguments
        1. @description
