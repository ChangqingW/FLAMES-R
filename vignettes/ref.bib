    abstract = "{Recent advances in sequencing technologies promise ultra-long reads of ∼100 kb in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to process such data at scale, which presses for the development of new alignment algorithms.Minimap2 is a general-purpose alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of ≥100 bp in length, ≥1 kb genomic reads at error rate ∼15\\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3–4 times as fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and is ≥30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one type of alignment.https://github.com/lh3/minimap2Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

	abstract = {Alternative splicing shapes the phenotype of cells in development and disease. Long-read RNA-sequencing recovers full-length transcripts but has limited throughput at the single-cell level. Here we developed single-cell full-length transcript sequencing by sampling (FLT-seq), together with the computational pipeline FLAMES to overcome these issues and perform isoform discovery and quantification, splicing analysis and mutation detection in single cells. With FLT-seq and FLAMES, we performed the first comprehensive characterization of the full-length isoform landscape in single cells of different types and species and identified thousands of unannotated isoforms. We found conserved functional modules that were enriched for alternative transcript usage in different cell populations, including ribosome biogenesis and mRNA splicing. Analysis at the transcript-level allowed data integration with scATAC-seq on individual promoters, improved correlation with protein expression data and linked mutations known to confer drug resistance to transcriptome heterogeneity. Our methods reveal previously unseen isoform complexity and provide a better framework for multi-omics data integration.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
