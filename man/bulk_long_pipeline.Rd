  annotation,
  fastq,
  outdir,
  genome_fa,
  minimap2 = NULL,
  k8 = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{annotation}{The file path to the annotation file in GFF3 format}

\item{fastq}{The file path to input fastq file}

\item{outdir}{The path to directory to store all output files.}

\item{genome_fa}{The file path to genome fasta file.}

\item{minimap2}{Path to minimap2, if it is not in PATH. Only required if either or both of
\code{do_genome_align} and \code{do_read_realign} are \code{TRUE}.}

\item{k8}{Path to the k8 Javascript shell binary. Only required if \code{do_genome_align} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{config_file}{File path to the JSON configuration file. If specified, \code{config_file} overrides
all configuration parameters}
}
\value{
if \code{do_transcript_quantification} set to true, \code{bulk_long_pipeline} returns a SummarizedExperiment object, containing a count
matrix as an assay, gene annotations under metadata, as well as a list of the other
output files generated by the pipeline. The pipeline also outputs a number of output
files into the given \code{outdir} directory. These output files generated by the pipeline are:
\describe{
\item{transcript_count.csv.gz}{ - a transcript count matrix (also contained in the SummarizedExperiment)}
\item{isoform_annotated.filtered.gff3}{ - isoforms in gff3 format (also contained in the SummarizedExperiment)}
\item{transcript_assembly.fa}{ - transcript sequence from the isoforms}
\item{align2genome.bam}{ - sorted BAM file with reads aligned to genome}
\item{realign2transcript.bam}{ - sorted realigned BAM file using the transcript_assembly.fa as reference}
\item{tss_tes.bedgraph}{ - TSS TES enrichment for all reads (for QC)}
}
if \code{do_transcript_quantification} set to false, nothing will be returned

Semi-supervised isofrom detection and annotation for long read data.
This variant is meant for bulk samples. Specific parameters relating to
analysis can be changed either through function arguments, or through a
configuration JSON file.

\details{
By default FLAMES use minimap2 for read alignment. After the genome alignment step (\code{do_genome_align}), FLAMES summarizes the alignment for each read by grouping reads
with similar splice junctions to get a raw isoform annotation (\code{do_isoform_id}). The raw isoform
annotation is compared against the reference annotation to correct potential splice site
and transcript start/end errors. Transcripts that have similar splice junctions
and transcript start/end to the reference transcript are merged with the
reference. This process will also collapse isoforms that are likely to be truncated
transcripts. If \code{isoform_id_bambu} is set to \code{TRUE}, \code{bambu::bambu} will be used to generate the updated annotations.
Next is the read realignment step (\code{do_read_realign}), where the sequence of each transcript from the update annotation is extracted, and
the reads are realigned to this updated \code{transcript_assembly.fa} by minimap2. The
transcripts with only a few full-length aligned reads are discarded.
The reads are assigned to transcripts based on both alignment score, fractions of
reads aligned and transcript coverage. Reads that cannot be uniquely assigned to
transcripts or have low transcript coverage are discarded. The UMI transcript
count matrix is generated by collapsing the reads with the same UMI in a similar
way to what is done for short-read scRNA-seq data, but allowing for an edit distance
of up to 2 by default. Most of the parameters, such as the minimal distance to splice site and minimal percentage of transcript coverage
can be modified by the JSON configuration file (\code{config_file}).

The default parameters can be changed either through the function
arguments are through the configuration JSON file \code{config_file}. the \code{pipeline_parameters}
section specifies which steps are to be executed in the pipeline - by default, all
steps are executed. The \code{isoform_parameters} section affects isoform detection - key
parameters include:
\describe{
\item{\code{Min_sup_cnt}}{ which causes transcripts with less reads aligned than
it's value to be discarded}
\item{\code{MAX_TS_DIST}}{ which merges transcripts with the same intron
chain and TSS/TES distace less than \code{MAX_TS_DIST}}
\item{\code{strand_specific}}{ which specifies if reads are in the same strand as the mRNA (1),
or the reverse complemented (-1) or not strand specific (0), which results in
strand information being based on reference annotation.}
